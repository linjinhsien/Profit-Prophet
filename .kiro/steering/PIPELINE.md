## Pipeline Overview

```
Stage 1       Stage 2              Stage 3       Stage 4       Stage 5              Stage 6
───────       ───────              ───────       ───────       ───────              ───────
PM        ──→ Architect + Dev  ──→ QA        ──→ CloudOps ──→ Architect+QA+PM  ──→ Audit
(plan)        (design+build)       (test)        (deploy)      (review gate)        (compliance)
                                     │                           │
                                     └── reject → back to Dev    └── reject → back to responsible role
```

## Stages

| Stage | Role(s) | Gate Criteria | Reject Target |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Plan | PM | Requirements + acceptance criteria complete | — |
| 2. Design + Build | Architect + Full-stack-dev | Architecture doc + working code + unit tests | — |
| 3. Test | QA | All tests pass, no critical bugs, security OK | → Stage 2 (Dev) |
| 4. Deploy | CloudOps | Stack deployed, health checks pass, monitoring live | → Stage 2 (Dev) or Stage 3 (QA) |
| 5. Review | Architect + QA + PM | Architecture compliance, test coverage, requirements met | → Stage 2, 3, or 4 |
| 6. Audit | Compliance-auditor | All compliance controls pass | → Responsible role |

## Available Roles (use `#` to activate)

## Handoff Protocol

Each stage handoff requires:
1. Output artifacts committed to workspace branch
2. Handoff checklist completed (defined in each role file)
3. Next-stage role activated and briefed on inputs

## How to Use

1. This pipeline file is always loaded — you always have stage awareness
2. Activate a role with `#agent.PM`, `#agent.Architect`, etc. in your prompt
3. Follow the handoff criteria before switching to the next stage
4. If a gate rejects, go back to the indicated stage and fix
